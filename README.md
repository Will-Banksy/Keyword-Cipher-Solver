# Keyword Cipher Solver
A program to assist in solving keyword ciphers, by forming it into a cryptogram (a classic puzzle).
Also provides functions to help with solving it.

I've embraced Metal (parts of it will look wierd if you change it)

### Compile And Run

-- Only tested on Linux, should also work on Mac, sorry Windows (but if you just follow along with the Windows equivalents of the commands in the shell scripts, that should work) --

Run Compile.sh to compile the program

Then run Run.sh to run the program

```bash
sudo sh Compile.sh
sh Run.sh
```
